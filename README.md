Pothole-Website-Demo
====================

Made by: Ellis Simmons - 2019 I think <br/>
Languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS

What is this?
-------------
This project is all about reporting potholes and other traffic sign issues to city officials.  
Right now, it’s set up for Pittsburgh only, but I might add more cities later.

What it does:
-------------
- Lets users report problems like potholes or broken traffic signs.  
- Sends reports to my backup email instead of the city officials (so it’s not fully operational yet).  
- A simple demo version of a city issue reporting tool.

You can see the site live here:

What you can play with:
----------------------
- The form for submitting reports.  
- The UI and layout in the HTML and CSS files.  
- Email handling is mocked by sending data to my email instead of official city emails.

Why I made it:
--------------
Initially a project for the Allstarcode camp that I participated in, made a couple changes now for practice while making my main website.
