# Pothole-Website-Demo

This project is all about reporting potholes and other traffic sign issues to city officials. Right now, it’s set up for Pittsburgh only, but I might add more cities later.

## What It Does

- Lets users report problems like potholes or broken traffic signs.
- Sends reports to my backup email instead of the city officials (so it’s not fully operational yet).
- A simple demo version of a city issue reporting tool.

## Check It Out

You can see the site live here:

## What You Can Play With

- The form for submitting reports.
- The UI and layout in the HTML and CSS files.
- Email handling is mocked by sending data to my email instead of official city emails.

## Why I Made It

Initially a project for the Allstarcode camp that I participated in, made a couple changes now for practice while making my main website.
